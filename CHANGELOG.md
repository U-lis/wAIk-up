## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Top bar toggle (sun/moon icon) that blocks lid-close and idle suspend while
  enabled, and restores default power behaviour when disabled.
- Logind inhibitor lock (`handle-lid-switch:sleep:idle`, `--mode=block`) held
  by a transient systemd user unit (`lid-awake-inhibit.service`) so the lock
  survives a gnome-shell crash; the unit is the single source of truth for
  toggle state.
- Screen-blank on lid close via `org.gnome.ScreenSaver.SetActive` so the
  display turns off even though suspend is blocked (on by default).
- **Keep screen on** option that overrides the screen-blank and leaves the
  display on while the lid is closed.
- **Restore on login** option that re-enables the master toggle automatically
  after the next login (off by default).
- Runtime dependency probing for systemd (`systemd-run`, `systemctl`,
  `systemd-inhibit`) and UPower on extension load; affected controls are
  disabled with an explanatory status line when dependencies are missing.
- `Super+Shift+L` keyboard shortcut for the master toggle; reads the actual
  unit state rather than the stored setting so it stays correct even if the
  unit was stopped from the command line; an OSD notification reports the
  resulting state.
- Preferences window (reachable from the menu item or the Extensions app) to
  rebind the shortcut, with conflict detection against window manager, shell,
  mutter, gsd-media-keys, and user-defined keybindings; changes take effect
  immediately without re-login.
- `Backspace` in the shortcut capture dialog clears the current binding;
  `Esc` cancels without making a change.
